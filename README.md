# Browser Databases

The `browser-dbs` package offers a clean and unified API to interact with browser storage mechanisms ([`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage), and [`IndexedDB`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/indexedDB)) from your applications. It streamlines development and eliminates the need for browser-specific code when working with client-side data storage.
